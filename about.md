Eduardo Nava is a strong programmer and systems wizard with lots of experience
working in IT for Fortune 500 companies and startups alike. He is most interested in
system reliablity and building services that scale. Currently attending Georgia Institute
of Techology in Atlanta, GA, he is heavily involved in the Society of Hispanic Professional
Engineers and other organizations on campus.

For fun he likes to play soccer and run albeit very slowly. His favorite player is Neymar
and he hopes to watch him win the World Cup in 2022.
